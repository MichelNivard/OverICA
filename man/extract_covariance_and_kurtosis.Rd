\title{Convert Moments Vector to Covariance Matrix and Extract Kurtosis}
\usage{
extract_covariance_and_kurtosis(moments, indices, p, third = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{moments}{A 1D torch tensor of concatenated moments from \code{compute_central_moments()}.}

\item{indices}{A list of precomputed index tensors from \code{compute_unique_moment_indices()}, containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{indices_2nd}: Indices for unique 2nd-order moments.
\item \code{indices_4th}: Indices for unique 4th-order moments.
}}

\item{p}{Number of observed variables}

\item{third}{A logical indicating whether 3rd-order moments were included.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{cov_matrix}: A (p, p) lower triangular covariance matrix reconstructed from the 2nd-order moments.
\item \code{kurtosis}: A (p,) tensor of kurtosis values extracted from the 4th-order moments.
}
}
\description{
This function takes the output of \code{compute_central_moments()} and reconstructs:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{covariance matrix} from the 2nd-order moments (only the lower triangular part).
\item The \strong{kurtosis} values extracted from the co-kurtosis vector (4th-order moments).
}
}
\details{
If 3rd-order moments were included in the original computation, this function
correctly accounts for their presence when extracting 4th-order moments.
